Localization and mapping for indoor wheeled robots have extensive applications, such as floor sweeping
and food delivery. In this paper, we present the RVG-VIW benchmark, providing sequences with the combination of an
RGB-D camera, an IMU and a wheel odometer (VIW), for the evaluation of SLAM and 3D reconstruction algorithms.
In contrast to others, the dataset focuses on indoor ground robots in a low camera view. With the ground truth trajectories
and 3D point cloud models supported by an accurate external 3D scanner, our dataset is capable of evaluating SLAM and
3D reconstruction in a global coordinate system. It contains thirteen challenging sequences from six different scenes, where
the ground truth is available for the whole sequence in large scenes. Moreover, our dataset comes with the intrinsic and
extrinsic parameters of sensors to support a fair comparison between algorithms.

1) office: One short sequence (office 1) and two long
sequences (office 2, office 3) were captured inside a small
office, where tables, chairs and office supplies are static.
2) floor14: One short sequence (floor14 1) and two long
sequences (floor14 2, floor14 3) were captured on the open
office floor of an office building, including illumination
changes, linear motion, dynamic pedestrians.
3) downstairs: A downstairs sequence (14-13-12) was
collected by a handheld device where the wheel odometer
data were missing.
4) two floors: A long sequence (14-13-14) was recorded
by moving on the 14th floors, down stairs (handheld) and
moving on the 13th floors.
5) floor3: Three sequences (floor3 1, floor3 2, floor3 3)
were captured along corridors with straight lines, dynamic
pedestrians, reflective mirros and a upslope.
6) floor13: Two longer sequences (floor13 1, floor13 2)
were recorded in the scene, containing rich linear motion
