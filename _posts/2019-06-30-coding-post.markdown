Localization and mapping for indoor wheeled robots have extensive applications, such as floor sweeping
and food delivery. In this paper, we present the RVG-VIW benchmark, providing sequences with the combination of an
RGB-D camera, an IMU and a wheel odometer (VIW), for the evaluation of SLAM and 3D reconstruction algorithms.
In contrast to others, the dataset focuses on indoor ground robots in a low camera view. With the ground truth trajectories
and 3D point cloud models supported by an accurate external 3D scanner, our dataset is capable of evaluating SLAM and
3D reconstruction in a global coordinate system. It contains thirteen challenging sequences from six different scenes, where
the ground truth is available for the whole sequence in large scenes. Moreover, our dataset comes with the intrinsic and
extrinsic parameters of sensors to support a fair comparison between algorithms.

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
 
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World')
})
 
app.listen(3000)
```
